# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
In this project, we aim to build a customized face recongition system by utilizing the abilities of pretrained models in object detection and face Embeddings. Face recognition is useful in security systems and commercial applications. To build such a system, three steps must be performed: Face Detection, extracting face Embeddings and training a model to recognize faces. We also investigate the usability of the system on surveillance images to find how powerful can those systems be in security applications. In addition, a custom dataset of personal images was created to evaluate the system.
